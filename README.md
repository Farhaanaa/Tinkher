# 🧠 MediMind

AI-Powered Medication Adherence & Risk Prevention System

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Medication non-adherence remains one of the most critical challenges in healthcare today. Studies show that nearly 50% of patients fail to follow prescribed medication schedules, leading to preventable complications, disease progression, and hospitalizations.

Missed, delayed, or inconsistent medication intake often goes unnoticed until serious health risks arise. There is a need for a proactive system that not only tracks medication usage but also identifies risk patterns and supports users in maintaining consistent treatment routines.

## ⚙️ MVP Architecture Decision

This hackathon version intentionally uses local state and browser storage instead of a cloud database.

The focus was on building a stable, fully functional MVP under time constraints, ensuring core adherence logic, risk detection, and refill prediction were implemented reliably.

The system is architected in a way that allows future integration with cloud databases and AI APIs.
