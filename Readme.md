MediMind is an AI-powered medication adherence and risk prevention system designed to help individuals take their medications consistently and avoid treatment interruptions. Studies indicate that nearly half of patients do not follow prescribed medication schedules, often leading to preventable health complications and hospitalizations. MediMind addresses this challenge by combining intelligent tracking, adherence analysis, and proactive alerts to support users in maintaining their treatment routines. By transforming simple medication data into meaningful insights, the system empowers users to stay informed, consistent, and in control of their health.

MediMind enables users to easily register their medications and daily intake schedules through a simple interface. The system allows users to log each dose as taken, skipped, or delayed, ensuring accurate tracking of medication behavior over time. Using this data, MediMind generates an adherence score that provides a clear picture of consistency while identifying patterns that may indicate potential risk. When irregularities such as repeated missed doses are detected, the platform delivers intelligent alerts to encourage corrective action before health outcomes are affected. Additionally, MediMind includes a refill prediction feature that estimates when medications are likely to run out based on remaining pill counts, helping users avoid unintended gaps in treatment. Together, these capabilities create a proactive support system focused on improving adherence and promoting safer health management.
